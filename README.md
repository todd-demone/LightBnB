* `public` contains all of the HTML, CSS, and client side JavaScript. 
  * `index.html` is the entry point to the application. It's the only html page because this is a single page application.
  * `javascript` contains all of the client side javascript files.
    * `index.js` starts up the application by rendering the listings.
    * `network.js` manages all ajax requests to the server.
    * `views_manager.js` manages which components appear on screen.
    * `components` contains all of the individual html components. They are all created using jQuery.
* `sass` contains all of the sass files. 
* `server` contains all of the server side and database code.
  * `server.js` is the entry point to the application. This connects the routes to the database.
  * `routes/api.js` and `routes/user.js` are responsible for any HTTP requests to `/api/something` or `/user/something`. `db/index.js` is required in this file so the routes can be connected to the database.
  * `db/index.js` is responsible for communicating with the database including establishing a connection. It also exports an object with a `.query` method that is called whenever one of the routes needs to query the database.
